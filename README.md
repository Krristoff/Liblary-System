We want digitalize the management of our local library.

A liblary is a place where users can borrow items. items to borrow are CDs and Books. Every borrowable item has a name and an ID. CDs have a certain number of trucks on them. Books have certain number of pages. Books can be Novel, Textbooks and Encyclopedias. 

Potential users are local residnts and students, whose name and ID we wat to save. Local residents can only borrow 3 items for 7 days, but studnes can borrow up to 5 items for 14 days. If a user been late returning items 3 times, then they are blocked from borrowing items in the future.

The hrad librarian wants to keep a record for each time an item has been  borrowed contatnig: the imte's ID, the user whot took it, when it was borrowed and when it was returned.

To publicly shame tardy residens, we need to konw which item is currently overdue fo rthe longest amount of time.
